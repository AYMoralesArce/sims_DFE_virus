#These are scripts used to generate all the plots in the manuscript: Inferring the distribution of fitness effects in patient-sampled and experimental virus populations: two case studies by Ana Y. Morales-Arce*, Parul Johri*, and Jeffrey D. Jensen.

#Following a brief description of what is where:

1) Scripts used to calculate the stats using sliding windows (in the folder called CalculateStatistics)
2) Scripts to perform ABC, and to generate the two plots of cross validation and posteriors for IAV + final set of statistics used ( in the folder IAV)
3) Scripts to perform ABC, and to generate the two plots of cross validation and posteriors for HCMV + final set of statistics used ( in the folder HCMV)
4) Scripts for simulating and using DFE-alpha to calculate the DFE in a model with progeny skew (in the folder DFE-alpha)
5) Script with bioinformatic steps to analyze patient data (HCMV) is found in the folder HCMV_bioinformatics
6) Raw data from IAV experiments, as processed by Foll et al. 2014, and script for post-filtering are in the folder IAV_raw_data
